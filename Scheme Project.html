<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this project, you will develop an interpreter for a
(slightly modified) subset of the Scheme language. As
you proceed, think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming
language; many quirks of languages are the byproduct of implementation
decisions in interpreters and compilers.</p>

<p>You will also implement some small programs in Scheme, including the
<code>count_change</code> function that we studied in lecture.  Scheme is a simple
but powerful functional language.  You should find that much of what you have
learned about Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to 
other programming languages.
To learn more about Scheme, you can read <a
  href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html">Brian Harvey and
  Matthew Wright's <i>Simply Scheme</i> textbook</a> online for free.</p>

<p>This project concludes with an open-ended graphics contest that challenges
you to produce recursive images in only a few lines of Scheme.  As an example of
what you might create, the picture above abstractly depicts all the ways of
making change for $0.50 using U.S. currency.  All flowers appear at the end of
a branch with length 50. Small angles in a branch indicate an additional coin,
while large angles indicate a new currency denomination.  In the contest, you
too will have the chance to unleash your inner recursive artist.</p>

<p>This project includes several files, but all of your changes will be made to
the first three: 
<code><a href="scheme.py">scheme.py</a></code>, 
<code><a href="tests.lg">tests.scm</a></code>, and <code><a
    href="contest.lg">contest.scm</a></code>. You can download all of the
project code as a <a href="scheme.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

<h3>Logistics</h3>

<p>This is a three-part project. As in the previous project, you'll work in a
team of two people, person A and person B. In each part, you will do some of
the work separately, but most questions can be completed as a pair. Both
partners should understand the solutions to all questions.

<p>After completing the first (short) part, you will be able to read and 
parse Scheme expressions. 
In the second (long) part, you will develop the interpreter in stages: 

<ol>
<li> Calls on primitive functions (those implemented in Python);
<li> Symbol evaluation and simple definition;
<li> Lambda expressions and complex (function) definitions;
<li> Calls on functions created by lambda expressions;
<li> Assignment to variables;
<li> Conditional expressions;
<li> The <code>let</code> expression.
</ol>

Finally, in the third part, you will write Scheme
programs.</p>

<p>There are 30 possible points, along with 4 extra credit points. The extra
credit problems are a bit involved; we
recommend that you complete them all, but only <i>after</i> you have the
regular stuff working. Finally, participants in the 
contest can earn up to 3 additional points, along with the glory of
victory.</p>

<h3>The Scheme Language</h3>

<p>Before you begin working on the project, review what you have learned in
lecture about the <a
  href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/book/interpretation.html#scheme-language">Scheme
  language</a>. If you would like to experiment with a working Scheme
interpreter, look at <a
  href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~scheme">Stk</a>, which is
installed on instructional machines as <code>stk</code>.</p>  

<p>We've implemented some standard Scheme procedures in Scheme, and you 
can look at these for examples.  They are in the file <code><a href="scheme_prelude.scm">scheme_prelude.scm</a></code>.
(The term <i>standard prelude</i> refers to any such collection of
definitions that is (at least in effect) executed to establish 
standard definitions before any program is run.)

<p><b>Read-Eval-Print.</b> Run interactively, our interpreter reads
Scheme expressions from the terminal (the standard input, to be precise),
evaluates them, and
prints the results.
Our interpreter
uses <code>scm&gt;</code> as the prompt.

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
  scm&gt; 2
  2
</div>

<p>The starter code for your Scheme interpreter in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code> can
successfully evaluate this simple expression, since it consists of a single
literal numeral.  The rest of the examples in this section <i>will not</i>
work until you complete various portions of the project.</p> 

<p> Certain expressions are given no specified value in the Scheme standard.
The STk interpreter (annoyingly, in my opinion) prints <code>okay</code> for some
of these and prints various random things for others (for example, it prints
the symbol just defined as the value of the <code>define</code> expression.)
Our interpreter, by contrast, returns a special value 
(called <code>UNSPEC</code> in the Python code) that the read-eval-print loop
does not print (likewise, our Python interpreter does not 
print <code>None</code>; however <code>UNSPEC</code> is not intended to be used
in programs, unlike <code>None</code>.)

<p><b>Non-standard Symbols.</b> Our Scheme subset does not have strings.
Instead, we use Scheme symbols for this purpose.  Officially, symbols in 
Scheme need only support a limited set of characters.  For example, whitespace,
parentheses, and apostrophes are not part of this set, for the obvious reason
that they have other lexical significance as delimiters in Scheme. However, Scheme
dialects are allowed to introduce various extensions that allow extended 
symbols containing arbitrary characters.  In our dialect, you can create
non-standard symbols using "|" (vertical bar) as the quotation character.
Within such symbols, you can use the standard Python backslash-escapes, with
the addition of <code>\|</code>, which is how one includes a vertical bar 
in a non-standard symbol. When printed using the standard Scheme function
<code>display</code>, the symbols are printed without the quotes and with
the escape sequences translated.   For example,

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   scm&gt; '(|ALLCAPS| |a string| |two\nlines| |\|x\||)
   (|ALLCAPS| |a string| |two\nlines| |\|x\||)
   scm&gt; (begin (display '(|ALLCAPS| |a string| |two\nlines| |\|x\||)) (newline))
   (ALLCAPS a string two
   lines |x|)
</div>

<p><b>Non-standard Functions.</b> 

<p><b>Load.</b> Our <code>load</code> function differs from standard Scheme in that, since we
don't have strings, we use a symbol for the file name.  For example

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   scm&gt; (load 'mytests.scm)
   scm&gt; (load '|filename with blanks.scm|)
</div>

<p><b>Exiting.</b> The functions <code>bye</code> or <code>exit</code> 
terminate the interpreter.  They allow an extra numeric argument giving the 
Unix exit code (0 for normal exit, non-zero otherwise).

<p><b>Words and Sentences.</b> 
Mostly for the heck of it, we've added a number of functions from the 
Simply Scheme extensions used in courses at Berkeley.  Specifically:

<ul>
<li> <code>(sentence A B ...)</code> concatenates lists, but also allows
  symbols and numbers as arguments, treating these as one-element lists.
<li> <code>(word A B ...)</code> concatenates the string representations of
the symbols and numbers A, B, etc. into a new symbol or number.
<li> <code>(first A)</code> the first item in (<code>car</code> of) A if it a list, or a symbol or
number consisting of the first character in A's representation, if A is 
symbol or number.
<li> <code>(last A)</code> the last item in A if it a list, or a symbol or
number consisting of the last character in A's representation, if A is 
symbol or number.
<li> <code>(butfirst A)</code> if A is a list, its <code>cdr</code>, and otherwise
if it is a symbol or number, the symbol or number consisting of all but the
first character in A's repreentation (abbreviation: <code>bf</code>)
<li> <code>(butlast A)</code> if A is a list, the list consisting of all but
its last element, and otherwise
if it is a symbol or number, the symbol or number consisting of all but the
last character in A's repreentation (abbreviation: <code>bl</code>).
</ul>

For example,

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   scm&gt; (sentence 'a 'b '(c d) '() '(e))
   (a b c d e)
   scm&gt; (first 'abc)
   a
   scm&gt; (last 'abc)
   c
   scm&gt; (bf 'abc)
   bc
   scm&gt; (bl 'abc)
   ab
   scm&gt; (first '(1 2 3))
   1
   scm&gt; (bf '(1 2 3))
   (2 3)
   scm&gt; (last '(1 2 3))
   3
   scm&gt; (bl '(1 2 3))
   (1 2)
</div>

<p><b>Turtle Graphics.</b> Finally, to keep up the traditions of recent years, we've added some
simple routines for <a href="#turtle">turtle graphics</a>, described later,
that simply call functions in the
Python <code>turtle</code> package (whose 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/turtle.html">documentation</a> we 
suggest you see; for one thing, it will let you try out turtle-graphics programs
in Python).

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>This time, we're letting you come up with tests.  As you complete
each problem, add tests to the file <code>tests.scm</code> of the 
constructs you have implemented.
expressions that you can examine and test to become more familiar with the
language. Each line that prints output is followed by the expected result as a
comment. 
  
<p>You can run all commands in a file using your Scheme interpreter by passing
the file name as an argument to <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>.

<div class="code">
  # python3 scheme.py tests.scm
</div>

You can also compare the output of your interpreter to the expected output by
passing the file name to <code><a href="scheme_test.py.html">scheme_test.py</a></code>.
<div class="code">
  # python3 scheme_test.py tests.scm
</div>
This is a rather useful script (we used it in developing this project and
its solution, for example).  As you'll see, <code>tests.scm</code> contains
Scheme expressions interspersed with comments in the form
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   ; expect 3
</div>
The <code>scheme_test</code> script collects these expected outputs and compares
them with the actual output from the program, counting and reporting mismatches.

<p>You can even test that your interpreter catches errors.  The problem with
error tests is that there is no "right" output.  Our script, therefore, 
only requires that error messages start with "<code>Error</code>".  Any such
line will match
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
  ; expect Error
</div>
There's an example in the initial <code>tests.scm</code> file.

<p>
Don't forget to use the <code>trace</code> decorator from the <code>ucb</code>
module to follow the path of execution in your interpreter.</p> 

<p>As you develop your Scheme interpreter, you may find that Python raises
various uncaught exceptions when evaluating Scheme expressions.  As a result,
your Scheme interpreter will crash. Some of these may be the results of bugs
in your program, and some may be useful indications of errors in user programs.
The former should be fixed (of course!) and the latter should be caught
and changed into <code>SchemeError</code> exceptions,
which are caught and printed as error messages by the Scheme read-eval-print
loop we've written for you.  Python exceptions that "leak out" to the user
in raw form
are errors in your interpreter (tracebacks are for implementors, not civilians).

<h3>Preliminary: Read Some Code</h3>

<p> This project is about modifying a modestly complex piece of existing code.
In such a situation, it's good to take time at the outset to read what's 
provided, try to understand what's there, and accumulate questions about parts
you don't understand <i>before</i> trying to mess around with it.  Indeed,
a lot of what you take away from this project will simply be what you learn 
by reading all the code you <i>don't</i> have to write.
In many
cases, you'll be able to experiment with parts of it in isolation, simply by
starting up an interactive Python session and using <code>import</code> to 
get access to the parts you'd like to play with.  

<p>Take a look over all the files provided with this project (with
your partner, of course).  Look particularly at
<code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code>, which defines the basic data
structures that Scheme programs manipulate (subclasses of
<code>SchemeValue</code>), and at the classes in
<code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code> that define the Scheme values devoted to
functions (subclasses <code>LambdaFunction</code> (for functions defined
with <code>lambda</code> and <code>define</code>) and
<code>PrimitiveFunction</code> (for functions implemented directly in
Python).  The implementations of primitive functions in
<code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code> may be useful to you in
understanding how these data structures work.

<p>In the file <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>, look at <code>read_eval_print</code>, which
is the top-level function that defines the interpreter's actions.
Look also at the class <code>EnvironFrame</code>, which represents environment frames
(just like those in the text and in lecture).  Look at the <code>run</code>
function and what it calls to see how the interpreter gets initialized and
how the global environment comes to be.

<p>You won't have to modify <code><a href="scheme_tokens.py.html">scheme_tokens.py</a></code>, but since you will
be modifying the reader (and since we can ask you anything we want on tests), 
it might be a good idea to understand the routines it provides and how they
are used.  At any given time, the "current port" is a <code>Buffer</code> 
(see <code><a href="scheme_utils.py.html">scheme_utils.py</a></code>), which is used to
provide a continuous stream of tokens from a token source.  See if you can
figure out how to look at the token stream produced for a small Scheme file.

<p>Finally, it would be a good idea to start trying to understand
evaluation, which is concentrated in the class <code>Evaluation</code>
in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>.


<h3>Part 1: The Reader</h3>

<p>The function <code>scm_read</code> in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code> is intended to
read Scheme expressions from the "current port" (input source) and return them
in their internal form (as various types of <code>SchemeValue</code>).  At the
moment, it only handles numbers, symbols, boolean values, and the end of file.

<p><b>Problem 1</b> (2 pt). Your first task, with your partner, is to complete 
<code>scm_read</code> by filling in the portions
responsible for reading pairs, lists, and items quoted by the apostrophe
(the reader is supposed to treat <code>'S</code> as a synonym for 
<code>(quote S)</code>).  

<p>The syntax for pairs and lists is
a left parenthesis, followed by a "tail", defined as

<ul>
<li> A right parenthesis, indicating the null list, or
<li> A Scheme expression, <i>H</i>, followed 
     either by
   <ul>
      <li> A period, a Scheme expression, <i>T</i>,
           and a right parenthesis. 
      <li> Or (recursively) by a tail, <i>T</i>.
   </ul>
   In either case, the indicated value is a pair consisting of <i>H</i> and
   <i>T</i>.
</ul>

<p>
The nested function <code>read_tail</code> reads the tail, returning its value.
For example, the value returned for "<code>(1 2 . 3)</code>" consists of 
the value of the tail "<code>1 2 . 3)</code>", which is 
<ul>
<li> the pair consisting of the Scheme value <code>1</code> and the value of the tail "<code>2 . 3)</code>", which is
<ul>
<li> the pair consisting of the Scheme value <code>2</code> and the Scheme
     value <code>3</code>.
</ul>
</ul>
Thus, the value denoted 
is <code>Pair(Number(1), Pair(Number(2), Number(3)))</code>.
     
<p>
As another example, the value returned for "<code>(1 2)</code>" is the value of
the tail "<code>1 2)</code>", which is 

<ul>
<li> the pair consisting of the Scheme value <code>1</code> and the value of the tail "<code>2)</code>", which is
<ul>
<li> the pair consisting of the Scheme value <code>2</code> and the value
     of the tail "<code>)</code>", which is the empty list.
</ul>
</ul>
so that the value denoted is <code>Pair(Number(1), Pair(Number(2), NULL))</code>.

<p> You'll be able to test the resulting reader by easily enough, since
the initial project simply prints the Scheme expressions that it reads
without evaluating them, so a Unix command like
<div class="code">
    # python3 scheme.py tests.scm
</div>
will just read <code>tests.scm</code> (or any other file full of Scheme
expressions), convert them to internal Scheme values,
and print out these values.


<h3>Part 2: The Evaluator</h3>

<p>The heart of the evaluator is the class <code>Evaluation</code>, which
corresponds roughly to those round-cornered boxes containing expressions and 
values with links to environment frames:

<center>
<img src="eval.png">
</center>

<p>That is, an <code>Evaluation</code> contains an expression being evaluated and
the environment in which to evaluate it, or else (if <code>.evaluated()</code>
is true) a value that requires no further evaluation.  Each call to 
the <code>.step()</code> method on an <code>Evaluation</code> makes some
progress towards a final value: either it finishes the evaluation (so that
<code>.evaluated()</code> becomes true), or it performs some of the evaluation,
and replaces its expression and environment with new ones that, if evaluated,
will complete the evaluation.  

<p> We do it this way to make tail-recursive programs into iterative ones 
(Python implementations will eventually run out of space if they pursue
a tail-recursive program too far, whereas in Scheme programs, tail recursion 
is supposed to be the same as iteration).  For example, if the expression
to be evaluated is a call on a primitive function, then one evaluation step
will evaluate the arguments and call the primitive function, completing the
evaluation.  However, if the expression is a call on a user-defined function,
then an evaluation step will evaluate the arguments of the call, then
replace the <code>Evaluation</code>'s expression with the body of the 
user-defined function, and its environment with a new local environment 
defining the parameters (just as we showed in lecture long ago for
Python).   Subsequent evaluation steps will evaluate the body. Take a look
at the code for the <code>begin</code> special form (<code>do_begin_form</code>)
for a simple example of evaluating a list of expressions, returning the 
value of the last one.

<p><b>Problem 2.</b>
First, follow the directions in <code>scm_eval</code> to make it 
actually evaluate expressions as intended.  

<p><b>Problem A2</b> (2 pt). Now we are going to get simple symbol evaluation and
definition to work. The first part is to handle the missing symbol case in 
<code>Evaluation.step</code>.  Fill this in to properly evaluate 
<code>expr</code> when it consists of a single Scheme symbol.  
There are
a few values you'll be able to look at: the values of primitive functions,
such as <code>+</code>.

<p><b>Problem B2</b> (2 pt).
There are two missing parts in the method <code>do_define_form</code>, which 
handles the <code>(define&nbsp;...)</code> construct.  Here, we'll do just 
the first part: handling cases like

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   (define pi 3.1415926)
</div>

where the defined symbol appears alone.  Fill in the missing piece to make this
work.  When combined with your partner's work on A2, you should now be able
to do things like

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   scm&gt; (define x 15)
   scm&gt; (define y x)
   scm&gt; y
   15
</div>

<p> Now that you can created symbols and give them simple values, it should 
be easy to come up with tests for A2 and B2 to add to <code>tests.scm</code>.

<p><b>Problem 3</b>  (2 pt).
The function <code>do_call_form</code> is
supposed to evaluate a function call.  It does so by evaluating the
operands of the call and then using the <code>apply_step</code>
method, which is supposed to be defined for the first, "operator", operand.
At the moment, however, it is incomplete.  Instead, the provided implementation
just evaluates the operator, and then simply calls the
<code>apply_step</code> method on it with no arguments.

<p>Also, neither of the <code>apply_step</code> bodies&mdash;that of
<code>PrimitiveFunction</code> and that of <code>LambdaFunction</code>&mdash;are 
complete.  Instead, they simply set the <code>Evaluation</code> they are
passed so that it immediately evaluates to <code>#f</code> (false).

<p>Implement <code>do_call_form</code> and 
<code>PrimitiveFunction.apply_step</code>
correctly. After you're finished, your evaluator should be able
to evaluate calls on primitive functions.
For example, you should see the following results:</p>
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
  scm&gt; (+ 2 3)
  5
</div>
(By the way: at this point, you can start calling the various
<a href="#turtle">turtle graphics</a> functions through your interpreter.)

<p>As always, your implementation should check for errors in the input line!  
A call such as 
<div class="code">
  scm&gt; (quotient 1)
</div>
should cause your <code>apply_step</code> procedure to raise a <code>SchemeError</code>, which the <code>read_eval_print</code> function will duly report.
It turns out to be easy to arrange for this.  The
<code>quotient</code> is implemented as a call to the Python function 
<code>scm_quotient</code>.  You might see what Python does when you call a 
function with the wrong number of arguments and figure out how you can use that
to solve the problem of detecting and properly reporting errors.

<p> Be sure you've added tests to <code>tests.scm</code> for what you've
implemented.  

<p><b>Problem 4.</b> Now we turn to user-defined functions, represented by
values of type <code>LambdaFunction</code>.  When you've finished 
parts A4 and B4, you should be able to enable the commented-out part of
<code>create_global_environment</code>, so that initialization of the 
interpreter will read in the Scheme <i>prelude</i>, a set of definitions of 
standard functions written in Scheme instead of Python.

<p><b>Problem A4</b> (2 pt).
Before we can call <code>LambdaFunction</code>s, we must be
able to create them.  At the moment, the <code>do_lambda_form</code>
method, which creates <code>LambdaFunction</code> values, is incomplete.
Finish it.  You can check your work by typing in lambda expressions to 
the interpreter.  You should see something like this:

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   scm&gt; (lambda (x) (set! y x) (+ x y))
   &lt;(lambda (x) (begin (set! y x) (+ x y))), &lt;Global frame at 0x848444c&gt;&gt;
</div>

For an explanation of why the <code>begin</code> is inserted, see the 
<code>__init__</code> function for the <code>LambdaFunction</code> class.

<p><b>Problem B4</b> (2 pt). The part of <code>do_define_form</code> that you
didn't do in B2 handles the shorthand form for defining functions, allowing 
you to write

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   scm&gt; (define f (lambda (x) (* x 2)))
</div>
as
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   scm&gt; (define (f x) (* x 2))
</div>

<p>Fill in this missing portion of <code>do_define_form</code>.

<p><b>Problem A5</b> (3 pt).
The <code>make_call_frame</code> method 
of <code>EnvironFrame</code> is incomplete.  Finish it.  

<p>Don't forget the cases where the
formal parameter list contains a trailing "varargs" entry, as in 
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
(define (format port form . args) ...)
</div>
One unifying way to handle this case along with the simple lists-of-symbols is
to consider the formals list as a kind of <i>pattern</i> that is matched against
the list of argument values.  That is, the formals list <i>matches</i> the
argument list if you treat each symbol in the formals list as a <i>pattern
variable</i> or <i>wildcard</i> that matches any expression.  Thus,
the list of values <code>(1 2 3)</code> has the internal structure 
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    Pair(<i>number</i>, Pair(<i>number</i>, Pair(<i>number</i>, NULL)))
</div>
while the formals list <code>(a . b)</code> has the structure
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    Pair(<i>symbol a</i>, <i>symbol b</i>)
</div>
These have the same form if we match symbol <code>a</code> to the number 1
and symbol <code>b</code> 
to <code>Pair(<i>number</i>, Pair(<i>number</i>, NULL))</code>
Likewise, the ordinary formals list <code>(a b c)</code> has the structure
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    Pair(<i>symbol a</i>, Pair(<i>symbol b</i>, Pair(<i>symbol c</i>, NULL)))
</div>
so it matches the argument list, too.

<p><b>Problem B5</b> (3 pt).
Likewise, <code>check_formals</code>, the method that checks the 
formals-list argument to <code>make_call_frame</code>, does nothing at the
moment.  Fix it so that <code>make_call_frame</code> can assume that 
its "formals" argument is correctly formed.

<p><b>Problem 6</b> (3 pt).
At this point, you should be able to get user-defined functions working
by filling in <code>LambdaFunction.apply_step</code>.  
Be sure to add tests for Problems 4&ndash;6 to <code>tests.scm</code>

<p><b>Problem 7</b>  (2 pt). Fill in the implementation of
 <code>do_set_bang_form</code>, which handles the <code>set!</code> 
special form.  Be sure to include a check that it has the proper form and that
symbol being assigned to is defined.  And, as usual, be sure to have
tests in <code>tests.scm</code>

<p><b>Problem 8.</b>
The basic Scheme conditional constructs are
<code>if</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>cond</code>.
In order to handle tail recursion properly, all these methods must be careful
how they perform their evaluations.  For example, consider the following
tail-recursive function

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
   (define (contains x L)
           (cond ((null? L) #f)
                 ((eqv? x (car L)) #t)
                 (else (contains x (cdr L)))))
</div>

If the <code>do_cond_form</code> method were to evaluate the recursive call,
then the Python interpreter would have an ever-increasing call depth as it
"cdred" down the list, eventually blowing up if the list were long enough.
So instead, <code>do_cond_form</code> (and the other conditional forms) must
use the option of modifying the expression to be evaluated and then returning 
without actually doing the evaluation.


<p><b>Problem A8</b>  (3 pt).

For the first half of the problem, fill in the implementations of 
<code>do_if_form</code> 
and <code>do_and_form</code> and test them.  

<p><b>Problem B8</b> (3 pt). For the second half, fill in the 
implementations of 
<code>do_cond_form</code> and <code>do_or_form</code> and test them.

<p><b>Problem 9</b> (3 pt).
The <code>let</code> special form introduces local variables, giving them
their initial values.  For example,

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    scm&gt; (define x 3) (define y 10)
    scm&gt; (let ((x y)
                  (y (+ x 5)))
               (set! x (+ x 1))
               (list x y))
    (11 8)
    scm&gt; (list x y)
    (3 10)
</div>

In fact, the <code>let</code> statement above is equivalent to the call

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    scm&gt; ((lambda (x y) (set! x (+ x 1)) (list x y))
        y (+ x 5))
</div>

so that the inner <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are separate from the outer
ones, and the initialization expressions in the <code>let</code> construct do
<i>not</i> reference the local variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.

Implement the <code>do_let_form</code> method to have this effect and
(need we say it at this point?) test it.

<p><b>Extra Credit 1.</b> (2 pt).
The <code>let*</code> construct is like <code>let</code>, except that 
each initialization expression "sees" the definitions that have gone 
before.  Essentially,

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    (define x 3) (define y 10)
    (let* ((x y)
           (y (+ x 5)))
       (set! x (+ x 1))
       (list x y))
</div>

is the same as 

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    (define x 3) (define y 10)
    (let ((x y))
       (let (y (+ x 5))
          (set! x (+ x 1))
          (list x y)))
</div>

and therefore has the value <code>(11 15)</code>, rather than
<code>(11 8)</code>, as it would for <code>let</code>.  Implement this 
special form (and, yes, test it).

<p><b>Extra Credit 2</b> (2 pt).
The <code>case</code> construct is a fancy conditional similar to the
Java and C/C++ <code>switch</code> statement. Here are some examples from
the Scheme reference manual:

<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    scm&gt; (case (* 2 3)
           ((2 3 5 7) 'prime)
           ((1 4 6 8 9) 'composite))
    composite
    scm&gt; (case (car '(c d))
           ((a e i o u) 'vowel)
           ((w y) 'semivowel)
           (else 'consonant))      
    consonant
    scm&gt; (define x 3) (define y 10)
    scm&gt; (case (car '(+ * /))
           ((+ add) (+ x y))
           ((* mult) (* x y))
           ((/ div) (/ x y)))
    13
</div>

The first operand is evaluated, but the first element of each of the 
subsequent operands is not evaluated (it's implicitly quoted).  As for 
<code>cond</code> the remaining items in the matching operand  are evaluated,
and the value of the last is the value of the <code>case</code>.  Implement 
and test this special form.  

<h3>We're There!</h3>

<p>You should have been adding tests to <code>tests.scm</code> as you 
did each problem.  In any case, make sure you have a reasonably complete
set, since the readers will be looking at it.  Your program should pass all
your tests when you (or the autograder) run

<code>
  # python3 scheme_tests.py tests.scm
</code>

<p>Your Scheme interpreter implementation is now complete.</p>


<h3>Part 3: Write Some Scheme</h3>

<p>Not only is your Scheme interpreter itself a tree-recursive program, but it is
flexible enough to evaluate <i>other</i> recursive programs. Implement the
following procedures in Scheme at the bottom of <code><a
    href="tests.lg">tests.scm</a></code>, along with some calls and
expected results.

<p><b>Problem 10.</b> The first problems (one for you and one for your
partner) ask you to implement some familiar operations 
<i>destructively</i>.
That means that the <code>cdr</code>s of the original list may be
changed and no new pairs should be created with <code>cons</code> or
<code>list</code>.  There's a definition of non-destructive <code>reverse</code>
in <code>scheme_prelude.scm</code> and there are implementations of 
<code>filter</code> on Python rlists in 
<a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/lectures/lect9.pdf">Lecture 9</a>. To see the desired difference between destructive and non-destructive
operations, consider:
<div class="code" data-lang="scheme">
    scm&gt; (define L (list 1 2 3 4))
    scm&gt; (reverse L)
    (4 3 2 1)
    scm&gt; L
    (1 2 3 4)
    scm&gt; (reverse! L)
    (4 3 2 1)
    scm&gt; L   ; L is now the last element of the reversed list.
    (1)
</div>

<p><b>Problem A10</b> (3 pt). Implement the <code>filter!</code> procedure, which
takes two arguments, a procedure name and a list and
destructively returns a list
that contains all elements of the input list for which applying the named
procedure outputs a true value (i.e., something other than <code>#f</code>).
Make your program  tail recursive.  It is easy to do this if you use
your partner's <code>reverse!</code> function.  Try instead to implement it 
directly.

<p><b>Problem B10</b> (3 pt). Implement the <code>reverse!</code> procedure, whic
takes a list and returns the reverse of that list destructively.

<p><b>Problem A11</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>count-change</code> procedure,
which counts all of the ways to make change for a <code>total</code> amount,
using coins with various denominations (<code>denoms</code>), but never uses
more than <code>max-coins</code> in total.  Write your implementation in
<code>tests.scm</code>. The procedure definition line is provided, along with
U.S. denominations.</p>

<p><b>Problem B11</b> (2 pt) Implement the <code>count-partitions</code>
procedure, which counts all the ways to partition a positive integer
<code>total</code> using only pieces less than or equal to another positive
integer <code>max-value</code>. The number <code>5</code> has 5 partitions using
pieces up to a <code>max-value</code> of <code>3</code>:</p>

<div class="code">
  3, 2 (two pieces)
  3, 1, 1 (three pieces)
  2, 2, 1 (three pieces)
  2, 1, 1, 1 (four pieces)
  1, 1, 1, 1, 1 (five pieces)
</div>

<p><b>Problem 12</b> (3 pt). Implement the <code>list-partitions</code>
procedure, which lists all of the ways to partition a positive integer
<code>total</code> into at most <code>max-pieces</code> pieces that are all
less than or equal to a positive integer <code>max-value</code>.  <i>Hint</i>:
Define a helper function to construct partitions. 

<p><b>Congratulations!</b> You have finished the final project for 61A!
Assuming your tests are good and you've passed them all, consider 
yourself a proper computer scientist!</p> Get some sleep.

<h3><a name="turtle">Contest: Recursive Art</a></h3>

<p>We've added a number of primitive drawing procedures that are collectively
called "turtle graphics".  The <i>turtle</i> represents the state of the drawing
module, which has a position, an orientation, a pen state (up or down), and a
pen color. The <code>tcsm_<i>x</i></code> functions in
<code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code> are the implementations of these
procedures, and show their parameters with a brief description of each.
The Python <a
  href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.2/library/turtle.html">documentation of
  the turtle module</a> contains more detail.</p>

<p><b>Contest</b> (3 pt). Create a visualization of an iterative or
recursive process of your choosing, using turtle graphics. Your implementation
must be written entirely in Scheme, using the interpreter you have built (no fair
extending the interpreter to do your work in Python, but you can expose other
turtle graphics functions from Python if you wish).

<p>Prizes will be awarded for the winning entry in each of the following
categories.
